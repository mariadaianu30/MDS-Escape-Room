## Project Overview

**AI Escape Room** is a browser-based puzzle game that reimagines the classic escape room format through the lens of artificial intelligence. The player is placed inside a virtual room and must explore the environment, collect evidence, solve logic and cipher puzzles, and interact with an intelligent assistant to receive narrative descriptions, contextual hints, and solution validation — all generated dynamically by language models.

The system is built around three specialised AI agents: a **Puzzle Agent** that validates solutions, a **Hint Agent** that delivers progressive clues without ever spoiling the answer, and a **Narrator Agent** that generates immersive atmospheric descriptions of the game world in the style of Victorian mystery fiction.

What sets this project apart from a conventional escape room is the degree to which AI is woven into the core gameplay loop — not as a bolt-on feature, but as the primary interface between the player and the game world. Every hint, every room description, and every validation decision passes through a language model. The game adapts to the player's progress in real time, and no two sessions are identical.

AI tooling was also used extensively throughout the development process itself — from generating user stories and architecture diagrams, to writing test suites and debugging agent behaviour. The full account of this is documented in the [AI Usage in Development](#ai-usage-in-development) section and in [`docs/ai-usage-report.md`](docs/ai-usage-report.md).

## Features

### Exploration and Interaction

- Navigate and inspect a room populated with interactive objects
- All interactive zones are highlighted; clues are visually distinct from background objects
- Click or touch any object to surface a close-up view, description, and embedded clues

### Puzzle System

- Multiple puzzle types: logic, pattern recognition, and cipher challenges
- Code-based locks that accept numeric or text input
- Correct code: object animates open and the attempt is logged
- Incorrect code: error message shown without revealing the solution; attempt counter increments
- Configurable maximum attempt limit; puzzle states persisted across the session

### Inventory

- Pick up collectable items that disappear from the scene on collection
- Browse the full inventory with item names, icons, and descriptions
- Combine items to unlock additional puzzle paths
- Inventory state persisted between sessions

### AI Interaction

- Free-text chat interface for asking questions about the game world
- All AI responses delivered within 3 seconds and reference current game state
- Contextual hints across three escalating levels — vague, moderate, specific
- 60-second cooldown between hint requests per puzzle; solution is never disclosed
- Atmospheric object and area descriptions generated on demand by the Narrator Agent
- Loading indicator shown while the AI processes; timeout handled gracefully

### Game Logic

- Real-time progress tracking across all puzzle states
- Visual and audio feedback on every puzzle completion
- Final door unlock triggered only when all puzzles are solved
- Victory screen displaying total elapsed time and score; optional leaderboard integration

## AI Agents

All three agents are stateless — game context is injected per request — making them independently testable and replaceable. All operate under a strict **3-second response SLA**.

### Puzzle Agent

Receives a player solution and the current puzzle definition. Returns a `correct` or `incorrect` verdict, logs the attempt with a timestamp, and assigns a difficulty rating. On failure, a fallback validation path ensures no game-breaking errors propagate.

### Hint Agent

Receives the current player progress state and the active puzzle identifier. Returns a hint calibrated to the appropriate escalation level: level 1 is intentionally vague, level 2 moderates the guidance, level 3 provides a specific nudge — without ever disclosing the solution. A 60-second cooldown applies between requests per puzzle. After three hints, the player is directed to keep reasoning independently.

### Narrator Agent

Receives an object or area identifier and returns a consistent, atmospheric description in the style of Victorian mystery fiction. Descriptions are varied across repeated queries to prevent repetition fatigue and maintain immersion.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python `3.11` or higher
- Node.js `18` or higher
- An OpenAI API key **or** a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance
- PostgreSQL running locally or via Docker

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-escape-room.git
cd ai-escape-room

# Backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
MAX_HINT_LEVEL=3
HINT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=60
AGENT_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=3
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/escaperoom
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Backend
uvicorn src.api.routes:app --reload

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

---

## Testing & Evaluations

The project maintains a minimum code coverage threshold of **80%** across all modules. Testing is split into three layers: unit tests, integration tests, and AI agent evaluations.

### Unit and Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run a specific module
pytest tests/unit/test_puzzle_agent.py -v
```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Playwright tests cover the full player journey: room entry, object interaction, puzzle solving, hint requests, and final escape.

### AI Agent Evaluations

Agent behaviour is validated against three criteria in every CI run:

| Evaluation | Criterion | How It Is Tested |
|---|---|---|
| **Hint Quality** | Hints must never expose the full solution | Automated string-match checks against known solutions |
| **Response Consistency** | Agents must stay in character across multi-turn interactions | Sequence tests with contrasting game states |
| **Context Awareness** | Responses must accurately reflect the current game state | State injection tests with known expected outputs |
| **SLA Compliance** | All responses within 3 seconds | Response time assertions in integration tests |

Evaluation results are reported as part of the CI pipeline output on every push.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

Automated via **GitHub Actions** on every push and pull request to `main`.

```
push / pull request to main
          ↓
Checkout repository
          ↓
Set up Python 3.11 + Node.js 18
          ↓
Install backend and frontend dependencies
          ↓
Run Pytest unit and integration tests
          ↓
Run Playwright end-to-end tests
          ↓
Run AI agent evaluations
          ↓
Generate and publish coverage report
          ↓
Block merge if any test fails or coverage < 80%
```

Pipeline configuration: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)

No code reaches `main` without a passing build. Failure notifications are sent to the team channel automatically.
